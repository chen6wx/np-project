NP-Problem: (Minimum?) Vertex Cover

Problem description: Given a graph of vertices and edges, your goal is to find a set of vertices where each edge has at least one of its 2 end points in this set. Minimum vertex cover is finding the smallest set of vertices to accomplish this task.

Program input format(Not fully sure what you mean): Our code for the exact and approximate solutions are functions that are given a dictionary that represents the full undirected graph we are trying to find the vertex cover for.
