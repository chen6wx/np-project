NP-Problem: Vertex Cover

Decision Problem: Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) and integer k, is there a vertex cover of graph G of size at most k?

Optimization Problem: Given an undirected graph G = (V, E) what is the smallest vertex cover?

Program input format: Input is an undirected graph. For test cases, we will be using text files containing the adjacency list.
